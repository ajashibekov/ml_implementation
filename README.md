# ml_implementation
My own workbook on implementing simple ML algorithms - a bit rusty, to be continued... currently covers:

Models
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Locally Weighted Linear Regression

Concepts:
- Vectorization
- L1/L2 Regularization
- Gradient Descent: Batch, Mini-Batch and Stochastic
